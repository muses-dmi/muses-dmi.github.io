      <description>Overview The ideal of compile once and run anywhere has been a dream in computer science for as long as it has been an area of research. From the early days of Lisp, through to Java and Python with its import ideal. However, to date these offerings, as amazing as they are, have failed to reach performance close to what system languages C and C++ can achieve.
Over the last few years a new kid on the block has emerged as an interesting inflection point in the search for a compile once, run anywhere target for compiling system based languages.</description>

      <description>Benchmarking Database for &amp;ldquo;There and Back Again: The Practicality of GPU Accelerated Digital Audio&amp;rdquo; This blog post is written to accompany the paper titled &amp;ldquo;There and Back Again: The Practicality of GPU Accelerated Digital Audio&amp;rdquo; presented at the conference of New Instruments for Musical Expression (NIME 2020). The paper can be found here, though the page limit meant that many details had to be left out. This post gives the needed space to cover the benchmarking methodology further, the details of all the tests and how to use the benchmarking suite.</description>

      <description>Benchmarking For justification purposes, performance profiling and benchmarking suites have been developed around the design and research of accelerating DSP processes like audio synthesis. Full databases of results and discussions are collected in this project.
Benchmarking Database - There and Back Again:The Practicality of GPU Accelerated Digital Audio For the paper published in NIME 2020, a database of benchmarking results were collected and discussed. All the results could not be covered in the limits of the conference paper, so the database of results can be found here along with further discussion.</description>

      <description>GPU-Accelerated Physical Model For Real-time Drumhead Synthesis This post covers the highlights of the code base used to present the GPU-accelerated drumhead physical model program. This application was demonstrated at the Audio Developers Conference (ADC 2019) and the conference of New Instruments for Musical Expression (NIME 2020). The application presents a model of a 2D drumhead physical model based on direct numerical methods from mathematical simulations. Specifically, the model uses finite differencing methods based within the time-domain.</description>

      <description>Numerical Methods for Physical Modelling and GPUs Direct numerical methods which have long been studied and applied in physics and mathematics are powerful schemes used to simulate physical phenomena. By simulating the physics of sound wave propagation through instruments and environments, new synthesizers and effects can be accuratly modelled. Physical modelling was for a long time impracticle to compute for most applications. With the level of computational power available today, they are becoming more viable.</description>

      <description>Audio Examples Perhaps the best way to get familiar with Pat is to take a listen.
We can listen to an example of Pat directly converted to audio in this example:
To help get a feel for what is happening, we can listen to this pattern looped, with some percussion used to ground where the sequence synchronizes.</description>

      <description>Muses Audio Platform We expose a method for configuring the step sequencer found in the Muses Audio Platform using Pat.
In this screen grab of the application, we can see the following pat expression has been used to layout the step sequencer:

      <description>Overview Pat is a miniature domain specific programming language (DSL) which is heavily influenced by Tidal Cycles. This language was implemented as a means to explore an abstract representation of sequences of musical events for digital musical instruments.
We have used Pat to illustrate a number of perspectives on this and will continue to use it in future work.
Applications - Audio Examples We can listen to an example of Pat directly converted to audio in here and get an idea of how Pat is used.</description>

      <description>Overview SVG Interfaces is an on going project exploring the design and implementation of custom controller interfaces, bridging the issue of user mapping between action and sound in interactive music systems. We have developed a simple framework utilizing functional specifications for musical interfaces and their mappings. The system is based on a subset of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG); interfaces are described using a simple Haskell based &amp;lsquo;controller DSL&amp;rsquo; or equally using a vector drawing application (i.</description>
